here i just jot down short summaries of the overall storyline of any novel that I read. I decided to do this since, I generally tend to forget the stuff i read surprisingly quickly. Although I cannot do full justice to the books in these summaries, since most of the good stuff in these books is their potrayls of characters and their relationships, this will hopefully help me to remember atleast the basic storyline of the novel, the recall of which will hopefully bring back the impressions that I formed while reading the novel. Its mostly for me, so read it if you want, but most were written within 15 minutes without reference to the book, and a few days after reading it, at which point I'd have forgotten most of the names, and the style is just random, stream of consciousness, and is very incohernt and rather concise, not really meant for someone who hasn't read the book.
