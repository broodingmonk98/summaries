This is a book by William Falkner. I mainly liked it for its writing style, and despite its deliberate incoherent nature, and fragmented narrative, or maybe because of it, it is quite a pleasure to read. I have to admit, I lost quite a bit of the main story, and plan to give it a second read sometime in the future, but the specific scenes painted by the author are truly fantastic and memorable and shall stay with me for quite some time.
There are four narratives. The first that of a metally challenged individual. His is the most incoherent of all the narratives and mostly gives a glimpse of the family situation, and personalitites of the people involved, as seen externally (without analyzing their internal thought processes as is done in most other books). Here, I guess we are supposed to form our opinion of the family.
The second narrative is that of one of the members of the same Compton (I think thats the name) family. He has been sent to harvard, by the selling of the family estate (by way of raising money). Following him through his day, and seeing his flashback to his life when he stayed home, is very nice, especially a few scenes, which are masterfully played out.
The third narrative is that of the guy who stayed back in the family, and was 'never given a shot' in life. He feels that he is quite smart, and is generally quite bossy, especially at home where he is the only 'man'.
The last narrative is from the same guy's perspective. His neice has run off, taking his money with her, and he chases after her. However he doesn't find her in the end.
Although this summary is terrible, I had a nice time reading the book, and would definitely recommend it. It is rather small, which would generally be a bad thing, especially since the focus would be on the narrative and there would be very little character development, but here its the other way round, and its small size suits it very well. Rating 9/10. Approx no of pages:270.
