11.22.63 is a novel by Stephen King. Its a sciFi thriller kinda book. Its got a nice writing style and character development, and is quite an enjoyable throwback kinda read. Its very descriptive as well, and paits a nice picture of the world. The plot itself doesn't have that much going for it, and the ending itself was a bit anticlimatic, without all the lose ends being tied up, but considering the ending of the dark tower series by the same author, I wasn't very surprised. Maybe you don't have the time tie up loose ends if you are producing books at the same rate as Mr King. The book is written in the first person throughout from the point of view of the protagonist.
	The book starts off with jake, a teacher in a local rural high school, the protagonist, talking about his inability to tear up on cue, and one of the few rare moments he actually cried, was when he read the eassy of one of his GED pupils, which despite of its terrible grammer, and spelling, had so raw an emotion that it brought tears to his always dry eyes. The pupil in qusetion is a janitor, and had a limp. In the essay, about life changing events, the janitor writes about how his father killed his mother and most of his family, and its brought to light that that's what made him the way he is now.
	Later on in the day, Jake is phased out after correcting the essays of all the honors students, which lack any spark of genuity, instead trying too hard to impress. Then he gets a call from Al, the owner and cook at the diner where he generally eats. This is very unusual since the two have never had any contact outside the diner. Once Jake goes to the diner, he see's Al a few years older and a lot the worse for it, than when he last saw him. That's when Al makes him go through the first the 'rabbit hole' for the first time, only for a few moments, so as to make Jake believe what he's going to tell him. 
	The rabbit hole is something in the pantry, and walking through it shall result in you coming out in the same place, but in 1958. Everytime you walk through it, you come out at that exact same moment. And whatever changes you do tend to stick once you come back to your own time. That's how Al had kept his prices so low, by buying food from nearly 50 years ago, when it was much cheaper. Now Al tells him that he had gone back to change the past, and save Kennedy who was assaninated nearly five years from the time which the hole leads to. However in the end he developed cancer, and was helpless and couldn't do anything. So with all his meticulous notes, he comes back and decides to tell his secret to Jake, and try to get him to take up his plan. Al continues telling an incredulous Jake, who can't believe what he's just been through, about the rabbit hole. He tells him about the experiments he's carried out, first making a mark on a tree, and finding that that mark had stayed on to the present when he got back, but then the next he went back, it must have resulted in a complete reset since the mark was not there once he got back. He then tried doing something bigger, he found out about a woman who had been crippled due to a hunting accident, around the time the hold leads to, so he goes back, and stops it from happening. When he comes back, the women had led a completely different life, and although one couldn't say whether it was a better one, it showed him that big things could be changed. However during this expidition he finds out that the past is obdurate, and a lot of seemingly random accidents try to prevent him from achieving the change he seeks. Another aspect of the rabbit hole is that however long you spend in the past, you come back to the time two minutes after you entered it.
	Jake although undecided at first, realizes that he has nothing keeping him at the present, having recently split with his wife, and being rather frustruated with his life at present. Its the janitors essay which finally makes him decide to go back, atleast to save the janitor, and his family from the formers father. He tell's Al his plan, of changing the past, by saving the family, and seeing how it would affect the present, since he's had personal contact with the janitor. If the past changes, he might never have met the janitor, and Jake is curious to see whether he shall remember his interaction with the janitor at all. Al agress, and so Jakes goes back to the past, and goes after the janitor's family. However the town in which the janitor lived, Derry, is a dark place, and something seems to be off about it. The people are especially hostile towards strangers. He eventually finds the father, and stops him red handed, but not before the latter kills one of the kids, and also makes a deep gash in Jake's face. Jake immediately comes back to the present, through the rabbit hole, so as to avoid unnecessary detection by cops. Al fixes him up, and then they discuss about what happened. It turns out that both Jake and Al remmeber the janitor, but the photo of the janitor is gone, so Al postulates that the present has changed, but Jake having gone through the rabbit hole, and due to Al's proximity to it, they both remember what had actually happened. The next day Al commits suicide, due to intense unbearable pain due to his lung cancer, which he got through excessive smoking, although he doubts that the past gave it to him, to prevent him from messing it up.
	In the suicide note addressed to Jake, he informs him that the diner will be locked up as soon as word of his death is out, and so urges him to make a quick choice, and either go back and change the past or just go on living his life. Jake calls up the janitor's house to see how things turned out, but the sister picks up instead of the janitor, who turns out went to the vietnam war, and was KIA. The sister seems to sense that Jake is someone special, and ask him if he was the gardian angel who saved them while they were kids, and then goes on to blame him for the janitor's death, asking him where he was when he got killed in the war. This goes to Jake's head, and he decides to go back and stop the assasination, which would prevent the vietnam war and millions from dying. He always has the option of just resting everything if things don't turn out to be better. So he goes back again, and this time he saves the girl whom AL saved, and then the janitor's family. He eventually makes his way to Dallas which is where the president's assasin turns up, after his sojourn in Russia.

The Novel was a nice enjoyable read, and has nice dialogue, nice realistical characters whom one feels invested in, and nice picture painting. However the main story leaves something to be desired, and the ending is not very satisfactory. Stuff like the grandfather paradox is completely ignored, by assuming parallel lines, which seemed an easy way out. The book doesn't really get into the paradoxical nature of time travel at all, abandoning it in favour of story telling. Would recommend it if you want something to pass the time by.Rating 7/10. Approx No of pages ~850.
