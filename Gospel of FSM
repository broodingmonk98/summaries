Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (hereafter referred to as FSM). Not sure who exactly wrote it. Loved the book, and the idea behind it.
The main thing I liked about this undertaking was that this is the best way to explain to someone why atheism is the way to go. While teaching a complcated subject, the teacher tries to explain stuff by using analogies and examples, and by drawing parallels. And most of the arguments used by the religious people, applies to the FSM, inspite of the latter being, as the creaters would probably agree, made up. Not to say that all religion isn't made up, it is, but the active practicioners would never concede to that. Yet they make non sensical arguments, and don't seem to understand either logic, or science, sometimes using scientific terms in the most ridiculous ways. So here in this book the ydo an amazing job of adressing the major issues with religion, while masquerading as a religion at the same time, answering things such as ID, with their own version, which also can't be disputed, and serious things such as if a kind and benovalent god, who is all powerful exsists, why is there any suffering, with answers like because he's kinda stupid/dumb and probably high. Over all amazing book and incredibly funny, like you think you can predict the end of a sentene, and out of the blue something pops up which really makes you literally laugh out loud, inspite of being alone in your room. 
Rating 9/10. No of pages : 150
