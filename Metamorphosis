This is a book by franz kafka.It seems rather overrated, and overly analyzed. I didn't find much of interest in the book, except its novel idea(atleast for that time). There is no deep mystery hidden in the book, which has some significance or tells us something about our human selves.
One day the protagonist wakes up to find himself transformed into an insect. He is quite put off, and is initially in denial, but eventually he accepts it. However he still tries to act like everything is normal and tries going to work. However he doesn't succeed and just stays in bed, unused to the control of his new body.
His work sends a person to check in on him, as he has just missed an important train. He is coaxed out of his room through subtle threats on the part of the check clerk. However upon seeing him he is horrified and runs away, the protagonists efforts at reconciliation and only making things worse. His parents and sister are also repelled by him.
Soon however a new routine ensues, with the sister stepping up and cleaning his room, and taking his food up to him. His parents still can't tolerate the sight of him. Although they are strained for money, they have put enough away, to survive on for a couple more years. HOwever small incidents, and a growing resentment on the part of the family towards our protagonist, makes the situation unbearable.
To supplement their income, they try taking tenants. However one day the tenants find out about the insect, as our protagonist decides to come our of his room, where he has been quarantined. Things go badly, especially with his father, and he ends up injured.
A living a few months like this, drains him. He eventually dies.
This was like Farenheit 451 for me, overhyped and doesn't live up to the promise. The content and writing were both subpart at best. Won't recommend it to anyway, despite its short size.
Approx number of pages ~100. Rating 5/10.
