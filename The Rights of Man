This is a book by Thomas Paine. I've forgotten most of the book, as well as my impression of it. However the overall theme was that this book was a response to another book by an English MP(?), which Paine critizes, in a rather sarcastic manner (which I found quite surprising). While Paines points will be take for granted today, I guess that at the time they were not all that commonplace. Paine is mostly for a republic while the MP is for a Monarchial form of government. Paine
levies several, fairly obvious, criticisms against a monarchy, namely that it has the wrong incentives (not the peoples well fair in mind), it need not reflect the needs of the people and causes great unstability due to the precarity of the life of a single person (their successor might be someone who advocates for entirely different things).
He also says that the claim that Monarchs have a right to power is not logically consistent since everyone were usurpers at some point. He also argues for a codification of principles in the form of a national constitution to symbolize that the government has duties, not inalienable rights.

For a reading perspective, the book is not too drab, considering its topic. Paine is mostly critical towards the MP since the latter is too complaisant to power that is. One can definitely read this book, and even find it interesting, although no point is truly thought provoking as they are, at least nowadays taken for granted. Approx no of pages 250. Rating 7/10.
