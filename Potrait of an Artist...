This is a book by James Joyce. It delivers what is promised in the title and gives a nice potrait of a young thought man. Especially nice is how he breaks things into phases, and relates each phase in adequate detail so as to give a window into the mind of the subject.
The book starts off with the author being a baby and googaing. It then goes on to describe the authors young life in school. He feels left out, and alone. Initially he doesn't have anyone to hang out with, and the teachers aren't very nice. He is bullied by the  bigger kids. This seems to be the common description of school life in most wester books, and I find it hard to relate given how peaceful school life was for me atleast. Anyway he continues growing up, nothing remarkable in that, and we see how he handles life away from home, the disputes at home, etc etc... At 16, he has sex with a prostitute, and for sometime, he is totally immersed in that life, almost wilfully throwing himself in that direction, almost as if to spite someone. However one day, he attends a sermon given by a priest, who goes into a very detailed description of hell, which he assures everyone, will be waiting for the sinners. And they shall have to be there for all of eternity, and human mind being incapable of appreciating large numbers and things like infinity, he goes into minute detail dsecribing the concept of eternity. 
The protagonist almost feels like all this is expressly targetted at him, and in in deep agony, feeling almost certain that he shall die immediately at the hand of god, for being a sinner and go to hell. The priest goes on to say that repentance is the only way forward, and now the protagonist becomes paranoid that he's going to die before getting a chance to repent. He feels a wholehearted, genuine shame for what he has done, and makes himself confesse his sins.
From that point on for quite some time he leaves a very austere life. However when he is adviced to go into the church, and become a priest himself, he reflects upon it, and soon rejects the opportunity presented to him, being brought back to the fullness of life by seeing the beauty of youth, in the form of a young woman. From then on in college, he decides that regardless of the punishment, if such a punishment is even there to begin with, he shall enjoy life now and live as he pleases. He considers himself a very thoughtful person, going to the vain phase of his life. However one day, an open discussion with his friend, with soon gets profound, makes him reevaluate a few things, and realize his selfishness. Its at this stage where he truly comes into his future life as an artist.

The writing was powerful, especially the sermon by the priest. The last half of the book was especially nice, and made up for the first half. I quite enjoyoed the read, and would recommend it to people. Its worth the time invested into it. Rating 9/10. Approx number of pages ~280
