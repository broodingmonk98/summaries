This is book 1 of the wheel of time series by Robert Jordan. Its not very good, but since its a long book series I thought I'd stick with it and give it a go. I may have been a little spoilt having read really good books leading up to this, and so my standards may be anomolously high. The book comes of as very generic, with none of the characters really popping out or feeling like anything other than 2 dimensional characters. The really impactful scenes, dont really land and seem
to miss the mark mostly due to not good (not bad either) writing. Despite being a fantasy book, the fantasy elements are not really given much focus, which would be fine if the lack of focus was due to subtlety, but again somethings off here.
The book starts off by introducing three youngish boys, all from the same village being the target of attacks by the evil ones minions. The trollocs attack the village which ends up being saved due to the serendipitious presence of an Aes Sedai and Warder. The Aes Sedai decides to take the boys along with her. Two village girls also end up joining the party. While they try to get away from the village, they are relentless pursued by the evil ones minions. This eventually
leads to the accidental splitting up of the party, and they continue their journeys separately for some time before reuniting. The evil one has been appearing in the dreams of the three boys, and this has taken its toll on them. The Aes Sedai realizes that the dark one grows more powerful, and decides that the only way to at least postpone the inevitable is to go to the eye of the world in the blight. There lies an immense power. Upon reaching the eye, after a lot of
hardships, Rand eventually ends up at least temporarily defeating the dark one.
While the book is not bad per se, its very banal. Its a good way to kill time though, and can serve as a nice distraction during agitated states of mind. Rating 7/10. Approx no of pages 800
