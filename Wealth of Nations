The wealth of nations written in 1776 by Adam Smith was one of the foundation books of modern economics, and the capitalistic system of free trade. Although I finished this book two weeks back, due to its relatively larger size, I kept putting off the writing of this summary due to my natural inertia. Finally doing it today. So the book itself was written by an insightful guy, which is immediately clear to anyone reading it. However it's style is a little dry, since most of the book is citing examples, mainly through the prices of things like corn in the past. Right now I'm reading das kapital, so should see how that will clash with the ideology put forward by the wealth of nations, which seems very reasonalbe and logical to begin with. The one great advantage I see in the system proposed by Smith is the freedom of each individual which it ensures. Also setting up of such a system, shall not put too much power in a few people, (atleast technically, the rich still are powerful, but theoritically the political power is not so much as to give anyone the power over the life of the average person in the society) and so would be easier to set up that a communistic form of governmnt. So without further ado lets begin.
	The book one starts off by talking about the main reason for the great improvement in quality of life that we see today, which is division of labour and its associated concept of trade for mutual benefit. Division of labour leads to specialization and vastly improves the productivity of a person or group of people who follow such a policy. Bigger markets are superlinearly better because Division of Labour is increases with the size of the market and so even greater specialization is possible. Money is just something to keep account by, since in division of labour, trade is essential, one person having a large quantity of one kind of 'good', more than he can use, and since he devotes all his time to the making of that good, he has to get his other necessities from others, and everytime he wants something, he'll have to trade them that which he has, which shall most of the time may not be desired by the person with whom he is trading. Money solves this problem by acting as a medium of account, and facilitating trade. Money is essentially just an account of labour, because in the end the only thing that people trade is labour for labour, each good's value being equal to the amount of labour put into it to produce it. In the sense that money is just an account, its unit doesn't matter, since in the end people are only trading labour for labour. So the real cost of a good is its cost in labour, while its nominal cost is its cost in money, and for the latter, the units of money matter, while for the former, they don't. The price of a good can be broken down into three main parts, wages which are directly related to labour, profits which are like wages for direction and coordination, and rent whose value is determined by the labour needed to attain it and its productivity. The cost of rent is less in the case of highly manufactured good as composed to more rude produce. Allowances in the price of labour are made in case of extreme ingenuity and skill or hardwork. The natural price of goods is the cost of that good, namely the sum of wages, profit and rent. The market price of a good is determined by the quantity of the good brought to the market and the effectual demand. The market price adjusts to the natural price since if its less, the supply would diminish, since no one would want to produce something which doesn't give 'profits' and if its above the natural price, more stock would be drawn to its production, since people would be attracted by the higher prices received, until it becomes the natural price again. However in a market the sellers, may try to hide the natural cost, so as to prevent this latter situation from happening, so that they shall get more 'profits'. A monopoly has essentially the same effect as such a trade secret.
	The produce of labour are a natural recompence for the wages of labour. Initially when there was no profit, and no rent, the cost of a good was cheaper (in terms of only labour) but with addition of profit and rent the real price increases. Now the master pays the worker for his labour and it is the master who sells the good, so his own labour is added to the good, and its cost goes up. Workers and masters interact via contract, and the price of labour is determined by a variety of reasons. Generally in an increases country, the wages of labour are very high, and in a stationary country the wages are low. The birth rate is almost constant, regardless of prosperity of a nation, but the rearing of children depends on the wages, and so the number who survive to adulthood depends on the wages. Hence in a rapidly progressing country the population increases, while in a stationary country it remains largely constant, everyone who can be supported by the land already being supported. There is more demand for labour in cheaper years than in dearer years. The profits of stock depends on availibality. Its more in the country than in towns which plentiful capital is availabe. Its also higher in poorer countries than in rich ones, and its also higher in rapidly progressing countries although they tend to eventually diminish. 
	The employment of labour and stock tends to lead to the same returns in all fields in case of perfect liberty and informtaion. If one path leads to higher returns more would go towards it which would bring it back to the natural rate. Inequalities in wages may arise due to agreeableness of employment, cost of learning the trade, costancy of employment, trust reposed and finally with probability of success. Most of these factors do not affect returns on stocks which are more evenly distributed than wages. Probability of success is however not accurately calculated, with probability of success being overvalued and that of failure undervalued, especially amongst young people. Generally wages for labour which doesn't fully occupy a person are lesser. Government policies, which serve to reduce competition also lead to this inequality. Encouragement of unions does the same thing. The inequalities do not depend upon whether the nation is progressing rapidly or not. The cost of rent depends on many factors such as availability of roads, fertility etc. The use of the land is regulated again based on the returns offered by undertaking.
	Book 2 is about the employment of stock, and its driving forces. Stock is generally a stored amount of labour, which is giving to those who want it, in expectation of its return with an augmentation to it. The amount of augmentation expected will depend mainly of the risk associated with the person not paying back the stock. The inequality of returns of stocks after accounting for risk is very low. Stock employed in maintaining productive labour is augmented where productive labour is that which in turn produces something of value, while unproductive labour such as an army or servants whose value produced is lost the moment it is produced, leads to a diminishment of the national capital supply.
