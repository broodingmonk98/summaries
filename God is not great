God is not great, is a book by christopher hitchens. Its a criticism of religion, especially the organized ones. I won't go in order since its not a story, and also because I don't remmeber the book in order. So Hitchens gives personal anecdotes as well as historicalc evidence to show how gullible people are, and how easily they fall for religion. Also most of religion is built around people not understand things, which at first glance might seem too complex. One of the more popular such occurances being propogating Intelligent design, hereafter refered to as ID, and citing the complexity of the human eye as an example. Every single person who makes this argument in earnest, has totally misunderstood evolution, due either to stupidity, or deliberate derilictiion to a proper understanding of evolution. 
	Hitchens also cites historical evidence, wherein religious sayings are outright false. He makes the standard arguments against religion, which most atheists, atleast those who are interested in debating the theists, have probably heard many times. And they all seem so common sensical that its surprising to see how anyone could object to them, until you meet someone who does, and then you understand. I'll try to handle this topic in an article, and since i don't remember that much from the book, although I'll remember the general arguments he made, given the context, I'll tie this up soon. One problem with this book was that the sentence formation and arguments were unnecessarily complex, which is very easy for any author to do, but prevents quick reading by the reader, and slows down comprehension in certain cases. however I liked it, but kept wondering, who among the people I know would fully comprehend such arguments when put across in this unnecessarily complex way. I'll end this summary, and shall try writing my own article on what I think bout religion.
