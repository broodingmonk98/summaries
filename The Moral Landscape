This is a book by Sam Harris. He tries to argue that Morality is not entirely subjective and can/should come into the relm of scientific enquiry. While I found myself disagreeing with some premises, and the book didn't feel particulary well written and did feel rather repetative, for the lay person (myself included), it did lead to some introspection, making it worth a read. It having been almost half a year since I read it, and it not being too memorable, I don't
remember my opinion about it so the rating is only approximate. Approx Pages 350. Rating 7/10.
