This is an epic by Homer. It tells the story of the trojan war, through its main heros. By modern standards, the style will be considered complete shit, but being one of the first western books in record, it is heavily recommended.
    Its been a while since I read this (probably around 9 months) so most of the details are a little hazy. But essentially there is a war between the greeks and troy, the pretence being the trojan prince Paris having eloped with the kings sister in law. Achiles, who fights on the Greek side is feels slighted and decides to sit out the battle, and complains to his goddess mother, who then makes a case before Zeus for her son. Zeus swayed by the beautiful goddess decides
    to make the Greeks lose until Achiles is back in the battle. Along the way we hear about the size of the two armies, and the character of some of the heros on both sides. Eventually the greeks win out, but all of this is mostly through the help of the Gods.
    I don't have all that much to say about this book, except that its simplistic treatment of war (almost like a marvel movie), and  the indifference of the rulers to the death of the soldiers, seems to show a lack of solid civialization, whatever that means. It is not a very enjoyable read, being rather tedious and repetative. Still better than the Quran though. Approx no of pages 400. Rating 5/10.
