This is a short book by Christopher Hitchens. It largely follows the narrative that he presents in his documentary, Hell's Angels: Mother Teresa. 
He makes a case against the much beloved public figure Mother Teresa. He offers several arguments as to why her status as all that is kind and pure in this world, does not hold water to even superficial scrutiny. A few arguments he presents (which I've ranked according my own feeling of their weight):
1) He thought suffering was good. She only wanted to assuage the dying poor, and speed their death to Jesus, and didn't even try to save those who could have been easily saved with minimal intervention. She though penury was a beautiful thing, and didn't really try to ameliorate the situation of Calcutta's poor, instead only showing up when death came calling, and made sure she 'really' helped them by baptising them, so that they can enjoy eternal bliss.
2) She regularly took money accured by exploitation, and essentially beautified those who played along. All this money went to further the catholic agenda. Most notably she was vehemently anti abortion and gave a terrible noble peace prize acceptance speech.
3) Her initial claim to fame was due to the incompetence and sensationalization tendencies of the media, and there were no real documented miracles (obviously)
There are several other criticisms such as false modesty etc. This is definitely a much needed voice in this one sided narrative. The writings itself was the usual Hitchens grandoise style, which is good. However the book does not go any deeper than the documentary and so didn't feel like a real addition, especially since the documentary probably reached a wider audience.
Approx no of pages 100. Rating 7/10.
