This is a book by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt. They try to bring economics
to the masses, by explaining the different between causation and correlation, along
with a few drastic examples, which the typical layman might balk at (just as the
typical layman balked at the idea of putting a price to human life), by also trying
to convince its readers that we live in the real world.
THe effort was laudable, and it might have made a good read for the high school
graduate or one without exposure to this kind of thinking, the level of writing
seemed to be aimed at a high school student, and I personally didn't find anything
truly revolutionary in this, although I can imagine a lot of people, especially
the  intensely politically (stupid) involved would. A few neat correlations were
edifying, but all that could have been told in around 10 pages instead of 200.
However the writing style, while a bit pedantic(albeit in a subtle way) was enjoyable
and so no claims there. There is really not much to say about such a book, expcept
to recommend it to the stupid ones in your life, as they might truly find it
revolutionary.Approx no of pages: ~200 Rating: 6/10
