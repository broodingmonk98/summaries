This is a collection of short stories by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It is actually the union of thee collections, the first one being extremely wierd, mind fucky stream of consciousness kinda rants, the second having more to do with life through examples of certain situations/settings, and finally the third one being more magicaly in nature, in his classic style. I liked the third part the best. There are a lot of subtle throwbacks to his other works like one hundred years of
solitude etc in the stories. One of my all time favorites, will definitely read again soon. The writing is of course absolutely beautiful. The scene setting is also really fantastic. Rating 10/10. Approx number of pages 300.
