This is a book by Bell Hooks. It is largely about banal things, which most people are probably familiar with already. I felt that it reads more like a middle school essay than any serious work, which engages your mind, and exposes you to new ideas/arguments and serves to change your opinion. There were almost no statistics quoted, and while the book was made so that everyone could understand what feminism is, I don't think that it will change any serious persons mind, as
there are a bunch of claims made, without any evidence to back it up. Anyone can make claims. I don't think I was exposed to any new ideas while reading this (rather short) book, and that is my main contention with it. Also there was a racial element in it, which seemed rather contrived. Rather than say, poor/working class, people of color was used. 
The main thesis of the author is that feminism is good, and everyone should accept it. However she spends a surprising amount of time, criticizing other feminists for brands of feminism which works only for the wealthy (white) women. She also repeatedly uses the phrase white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, which, probably valid to an extend, becomes rather comical due to overuse. The author also seems to want a more radical change, instead of working within capitalism
to give women equal rights. Almost the entire book is spent criticizing the modern system, and making claims about how life is for women (which I did largely believe), but no plausible counter system is offered. (Its been a while since I read it, if one was offered, it was probably not focused on very much).
