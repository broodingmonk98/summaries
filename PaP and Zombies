This is essentially an edit of the original (wonderful) Pride and Prejudice by sprinkling zombies here and there. Since I've summarized PaP somewhere else, I won't do so here.
This book doesn't add much to the original and retains probably over 90% of the source material. It does detract from the original due to the authors inferiority when compared to Jane Austen, and doesn't really add anything much, so I don't really see a point of this existing. However it may get more people to read Austen, and might serve an indirect purpose in that way. Reads more like fan fiction than a serious attempt at writing. Approx no of pages 350. Rating 8/10. (The
original is a 10/10 for me, its really an amazing book).
