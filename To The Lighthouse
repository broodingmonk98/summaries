This is a book by Virginia Wolf. It has the stream of consciousness style which I've grown to love and hate. While it doesn't make for easy reading (which is mostly what I'm looking for in a novel, as it serves as an intermission for me betewen reading more nerve racking textbooks), it does have, argubly, some of the best dipictions of typical everyday banal person one is apt to encounter, rather than the usual treatment of hero's/heroines, typically young and
typically perfect if not obviously, at least not fully fleshed out (like Stephen Kings characters, which only belie a sense of depth). The writing style is rather painful at times, but I'll probably have to give it another read before saying anything about it (by paying more attention, I was pretty zoned out the first time round).
The book mostly deals with the life's of a fairly large rich household, and follows the thoughts of the lady of the house (largely), and the observations she makes. We are made privy to her interactions with the others as well as her opinions and thoughts, on two distinct days 10 years apart. I can't really say anything more about the plot, as its not really that important. But its fairly obvious that the author is a smart person who has an exception skill in expressing rather nebulous
ideas that flash around in everyones heads. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who has been a fairly avid reader at least for a year or two. It really is a breath of fresh air, and rises above the banal storylines and plot points that we've all come to expect. Approx no of pages 200. Rating 9/10.
